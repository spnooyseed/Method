This paper explores the untapped potential of generative SSL for graph-based recommender systems. We highlight two critical challenges: firstly, designing effective diffusion mechanisms to enhance semantic information and collaborative signals while avoiding optimization biases; and secondly, developing adaptive structural masking mechanisms within graph diffusion to improve overall model performance. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel approach: the Guided Diffusion enhanced Mask graph AutoEncoder (GDiffMAE). GDiffMAE integrates an adaptive mask encoder for structural reconstruction and a guided diffusion model for semantic reconstruction, addressing the limitations of current methods.
